# these are given as debian/ubuntu package names.
# to install in these distributions use (as root or with
# sudo):
# > apt-get install {packagename}

# most other distributions will have the appropriate
# package as well; it's up to you to find out what it is.
# if you don't know what a package is or does,
# search for it on http://packages.ubuntu.com/
# and you should be able to find the analog for your system
# if that fails, you can always download and compile from source
#
# if you need to compile boost from source, I recommend
# the boost-cmake distribution rather than the official
# bjam distribution. See https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/CMake
