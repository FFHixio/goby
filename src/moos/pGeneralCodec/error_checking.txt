where are errors handled and by whom?

exceptions: SAXException, XMLException, general exceptions due to parsing of XML files
            - message_xml_parser.cpp
            / print error and exit

            SAXParseException: errors thrown on parsing (like missing tags)
            - message_xml_callbacks.h
            / print error with line number and exit


to deal with still:
proper structure and data (schema) - need to see what cannot be handled
by the schema that we need to consider

<format></format>: make sure correct number of message_vars are given
