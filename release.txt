Goby Release Notes (Major version 2)

*****************
Version 2.0.1~rc1

- Release candidate 1: all version 2 functionality complete; documentation still needs to be finished.
- Wire format of DCCL message changed to be little-endian for both body and header (previously header was big-endian and body was little-endian). This release is wire-incompatible with previous betas.
- Added set of CCL messages implemented as subset of DCCL.
- "dccllite" option added for compiling DCCL alone with a minimum of other dependencies within Goby and external.
- Basic router and two drivers added to support "traditional" networking (TCP / UDP) over slow links (predominantly Iridium)

345: Toby Schneider 2012-05-07 {2.0.1~rc1} added new acomms chapter
344: Toby Schneider 2012-05-04 1. Work on Goby2 user manual: MOOS and Acomms components; 2. Changed TransmissionType enumeration in DriverBase to have DRIVER_SPECIFIC value and removed all MICROMODEM_* values and put them in mm_driver.proto extensions; 3. Added prefix for pAcommsHandler MOOS variables
343: Toby Schneider 2012-05-03 added rounding to legacy CCL encoding for vehicle speed to avoid incorrect values due to truncation
342: Toby Schneider 2012-05-03 Changed DCCLFieldCodecBase::any_size and any_size_repeated to use WireType instead of FieldType to make it the same as encode
341: Toby Schneider 2012-05-03 changed CCL Error message to use bytes codec to avoid default DCCL string 1 byte overhead
340: Toby Schneider 2012-05-01 changed ccl_compatible flag to a selectable enumeration of various identifier codec options (with varint still being the default)
339: Toby Schneider 2012-05-01 added CCL message: MDAT_COMMAND
338: Toby Schneider 2012-05-01 completed implementation of base set of CCL messages: MDAT_EMPTY MDAT_REDIRECT MDAT_BATHY MDAT_CTD MDAT_STATE
337: Toby Schneider 2012-05-01 moved all #include <boost/filesystem.hpp> to .cpp files to avoid bug where including that header brings in a library dependency on boost_system
336: Toby Schneider 2012-04-30 Corrected fix for 64-bit architecture in CCL Lat/Long routine
335: Toby Schneider 2012-04-30 Renamed DCCLDefaultArithmeticFieldCodec to DCCLDefaultNumericFieldCodec to avoid confusion with arithmetic coding (which DCCLDefaultNumericFieldCodec does not do)
334: Toby Schneider 2012-04-30 Nearly finished with CCL State message - cleaned up traversal of message Body and Head for custom embedded messages
333: Toby Schneider 2012-04-30 Started added Legacy CCL as subset of DCCL
332: Toby Schneider 2012-04-27 1. Changed confusing wire format of DCCL where header was big-endian and body was little-endian. Entire message is sent as little-endian now, so header starts at the least significant byte and works upwards. This will break compatibility with prior beta releases of Goby2 but that's why we're still in beta. 2. Started adding CCL compatibility option
331: Toby Schneider 2012-04-26 Much cleaning up in Liaison scope: pause correctly still reads mail in another thread to avoid huge bandwidth and CPU hit when resuming. Made ZeroMQService poll() thread-safe. Added MOOS translator with type name prefix
330: Toby Schneider 2012-04-25 added missing header in goby_bridge
329: Toby Schneider 2012-04-25 Added ability to compile goby-logger without thread-safety (boost thread) and DynamicProtobufManager without ability to read files from disk (boost filesystem)
328: Chris Murphy 2012-04-25 Removing a duplicate include from flex_ostream.h
327: Chris Murphy 2012-04-25 Adding a 'dccllite' option, which builds a minimal DCCL shared library.  The goal is to have it use the minimum required code to support DCCL functionality, and only require linking against protobuf, dccl, and maybe dl or m or the like.  Still tracking down a boost::system dependency, which sneaks in somewhere.
326: Chris Murphy 2012-04-25 Adding an include line for dlfcn, since dccl.cpp calls dlsym.
325: Toby Schneider 2012-04-24 [merge] merge from 2.0-dsop
  321.1.10: Toby Schneider 2012-04-24 in DCCL, replaced boost::dynamic_bitset and get_more_bits signal with custom class based on std::deque<bool>
