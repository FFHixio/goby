\section{What is Goby?}

The Goby Underwater Autonomy Project is an \gls{autonomy architecture} tailored for marine robotics with a focus on intervehicle communication.

Currently, Goby has two major parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Goby-Acomms: The Goby Acoustic Communications libraries (\verb|goby-acomms|) are provided for Version 1.1. See the Developers' documentation for details on these libraries at \cite{goby-doc}. Users of the MOOS application \verb|pAcommsHandler| should see Chapter \ref{chap:MOOS}.
\item Goby-Core: An \gls{autonomy architecture} that ties together various marshalling schemes (Google Protocol Buffers, MOOS, LCM, etc.) and provides a message passing middleware based on ZeroMQ (for ethernet) and Goby-DCCL (for acoustic communications). Goby-Core will be provided in release version 2.0.
\end{itemize}

\section{Structure of this Manual}
This manual covers the MOOS Applications that use Goby-Acomms release version 1.1. If you are interested in the C++ Goby-Acomms libraries directly, please read the online Developers' documentation at \cite{goby-doc} In fact, you may want to go download and install Goby now before reading further: \url{https://launchpad.net/goby}.

\section{How to get help}
The Goby community is here to support you. This is an open source project so we have limited time and resources, but you will find that many are willing to contribute their help, with the hope that you will do the same as you gain experience. Please consult these resources and people, probably in this order of preference:
