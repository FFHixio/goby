Goby is currently written entirely in C++. We hope to support more languages in the future, but we feel that C++ is a good blend of elegance, speed, and power. While the core of Goby is based on a number of advanced C++ techniques, you only need a small amount of C++ knowledge to get started writing your own Goby application. If you are new to programming and C++, we recommend Prata's \textit{C++ Primer Plus} \cite{Prata:2001:CPP:515923}. If you are experienced in programming but new to C++, we recommend Stroustrup's \textit{The C++ Programming Language} \cite{Stroustrup:2000:CPL:518791}. The website \url{www.cplusplus.com} is an excellent online reference.

This complete example is located at the end of this chapter in section \ref{sec:hello_example_code}. It's probably a good idea to download and install Goby now so you can try this out for yourself: \url{https://launchpad.net/goby}.

This example involves passing a single type of message (class HelloWorldMsg) from one Goby application (!hello_world1_g!\footnote{you can name your applications whatever you want, but we like appending ``\_g'' to the end to indicate that this is a Goby application.}) to another (!hello_world2_g!). Since Goby has a \gls{star topology}, !gobyd! will mediate this transaction.

For this example we will write two Goby applications and one \gls{protobuf} message. See Fig. \ref{fig:hello_world_structure} for the software structure of this example.

Both of them (dashed arrows) depend on the Protocol Buffers message \texttt{HelloWorldMsg} because they use it to communicate. They also both depend on \texttt{goby::core::Daemon} (\texttt{gobyd}) for passing this message. See Fig. \ref{fig:hello_world_sequence} for the sequence of sending a message in this example.}

\section{Meeting goby::core::ApplicationBase}

!goby::core::ApplicationBase! is the building block (\gls{base class}) upon which we will make our Goby applications (which will be \glspl{derived class} of ApplicationBase). !ApplicationBase! provides us with a number of tools; the main ones are:

\begin{itemize}
\item a constructor !ApplicationBase()! that reads the command line and configuration (we will learn about this later) and connects to the Goby \gls{daemon} (!gobyd!) for us.
\item a virtual method !loop()! that is called at a regular frequency (10 Hertz by default).
\item a method !subscribe()! which tells !gobyd! that we wish to receive all messages of this type.
\item a method !newest()! which returns the newest (latest received) message of a given type that we have previously called !subscribe()! for. We will learn how to filter the subscriptions later.
\item a method !publish()! allowing us to publish messages to !gobyd! and thereby to any subscribers of that type.
\item a method !glogger()! which acts just like std::cout\footnote{\texttt{glogger()} accesses an instantiation of goby::util::FlexOstream, a derived class of std::ostream. std::cout is also a derived class of std::ostream.} and lets us write to the debug (terminal window / text file) \textit{g}oby \textit{logger}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Creating a simple Google Protocol Buffers Message: HelloWorldMsg}\label{sec:proto_ex}

\glsreset{protobuf} \gls{protobuf} allows us to create custom objects for holding and transmitting data in a structured fashion. Transmitting data typically is done in a long string of bytes. However, humans do not view the world as a string of bytes. We think and communicate using tangible and intangible objects. For example, a baseball might be described by its diameter, color, weight, and materials. Goby (using protobuf objects) allows messages to be formed using this more natural object-based representation.

The \gls{protobuf} language is simple with a syntax similar to that of C. Protobuf messages are written in .proto files and passed to the protobuf compiler (!protoc!) which generates C++ code to pass to the C++ compiler (!gcc! on Linux). Protobuf messages can contain a number of basic types (or vectors of these types) as well as nested messages. Fields are labeled as required, optional or repeated (essentially a vector). Required fields must be filled in; clearly, optional fields can be omitted. This might be a good time to read the Protocol Buffers tutorial \cite{proto-tutorial} to get a feel for the language and usage.

As you become familiar with using \gls{protobuf}, the language reference \cite{proto-lang-ref} will help you in creating .proto files and the generated code reference \cite{proto-gen-code} will assist you in accessing the C++ classes created by the .proto files when passed through !protoc!.

For this example, we wish to send ``hello world'' (of course) so we need a string to hold our message that we will call `telegram': 
\begin{verbatim}
required string telegram = 1;
\end{verbatim}
The ! = 1! simply indicates that `telegram' is the first field in the message !HelloWorldMsg!. Furthermore, we want to keep track of how many times we've said ``hello'' so we'll add an unsigned integer called `count'
\begin{verbatim}required uint32 count = 2;\end{verbatim}
The resulting .proto file is given in section \ref{sec:hello_world.proto}.

We chose `required' to prefix both fields because we feel that a valid !HelloWorldMsg! must contain both a `telegram' and a `count.' !uint32! is an unsigned (non-negative) 32 bit integer. The numbers following the ``='' sign are unique identifiers for each field. These numbers can be chosen however one likes as long as they are unique within a given protobuf message. Ascending numbers in the order fields are declared in the file is a reasonable choice.

This .proto file is ``compiled'' into a class with the same name as the message (!HelloWorldMsg!). This class is accessed by including a header file with the same name as the .proto file, but with ``.proto'' replaced with ``.pb.h''. Furthermore, we can set the contents of this class using calls (``mutators'' or ``setters'') that are the same as the field name (i.e. `telegram' or `count') prepended with ``set\_'':
\begin{boxedverbatim}
// C++ 
#include "hello_world.pb.h"

// create and populate a ``HelloWorldMsg'' called `msg'
HelloWorldMsg msg;
msg.set_telegram("hello world");
msg.set_count(3);
\end{boxedverbatim}
\resetbvlinenumber

and access them using these methods (``accessors'' or ``getters'') that have the same function name as the field name:

\begin{boxedverbatim}
// C++ 
// print information about `msg' to the screen
std::cout << msg.telegram() << ": " << msg.count() << std::endl;
\end{boxedverbatim}
\resetbvlinenumber


\section{Learning how to \textit{publish}: HelloWorld1}

To create a Goby application, one needs to

\begin{itemize}
\item create a derived class of !goby::core::ApplicationBase!. We also must include the goby core header (!#include "goby/core/core.h"!).
\item run the application using the !goby::run()! function. Because goby::core::ApplicationBase reads our configuration (including command line options) for us, we also pass !argv! and !argc! to !run()!.
\end{itemize}

That is all one needs to create a valid working Goby application. All together the ``bare-bones'' Goby application looks like:

\begin{boxedverbatim}
#include "goby/core/core.h"

class HelloWorld1 : public goby::core::ApplicationBase {};

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{   
    return goby::run<HelloWorld1>(argc, argv);
}
\end{boxedverbatim}
\resetbvlinenumber

However, we would like our application to do a little bit more.

ApplicationBase provides a \gls{virtual} method called !loop()! that is called on some regular interval (it is the \textit{\gls{synchronous} event} in Goby), by default 10 Hertz. By overloading !loop()! in our derived class !HelloWorld1!, we can do any kind of synchronous work that needs to be done without tying up the CPU all the time\footnote{in between calls to \texttt{loop()}, ApplicationBase handles incoming subscribed messages}. In this example, we will create a simple message (of type HelloWorldMsg which we previously designed in chapter \ref{sec:proto_ex}) and publish it to !gobyd! and thus all subscribers (we create a subscriber in chapter \ref{sec:sub_ex}). 

Let's walk through each line of our !loop()! method:

\begin{boxedverbatim}
void loop()
{
   static int i = 0;
   HelloWorldMsg msg;
   msg.set_telegram("hello world!");
   msg.set_count(++i);
   glogger() << "sending: " << msg << std::endl;
   publish(msg);
}
\end{boxedverbatim}
\resetbvlinenumber

Line !1!: !loop()! takes no arguments and returns nothing (void). We declare (line !3!) a static integer\footnote{static in this context means that the variable will keep its value across calls to the function \texttt{loop()}.} to keep track of how many times we have looped and thus print an increasing integer value. Then we create a HelloWorldMsg called msg (line !4!) and set the values of its fields (lines !5! and !6!). We then publish a human debugging log message using !glogger()! (just like std::cout or other std::ostreams), which will be put to the terminal window in verbose mode\footnote{goby provides operator<< for google::protobuf::Message objects as a wrapper for google::protobuf::Message::DebugString()}. Finally, we publish our message (line !8!). The entirety of the code for !hello_world1_g! is listed in section \ref{sec:hello_world1.cpp}.

\section{Learning how to \textit{subscribe}: HelloWorld2} \label{sec:sub_ex}

Now that our !hello_world1_g! application is publishing a message, we would like to create an application that subscribes for it. To subscribe for a message, we typically provide two things:
\begin{itemize}
\item The type of the message we want to subscribe for (e.g. !HelloWorldMsg!).
\item A method or function that should be called when we receive that type (a callback).
\end{itemize}

Subscriptions typically take place in the constructor (here, !HelloWorld2::HelloWorld2()!), but can happen at any time as needed (within !loop()!, for example). You subscribe for a type once, and then you will continue to receive all other applications' publishes to that type.

We subscribe for a type using a call to !subscribe()! that looks like this:
\begin{boxedverbatim}
subscribe<HelloWorldMsg>(&HelloWorld2::receive_msg, this);
\end{boxedverbatim}
\resetbvlinenumber

While a bit complicated at first, this call should make sense shortly. It reads ``!subscribe! for all messages of type !HelloWorldMsg! and when you receive one, call the method !HelloWorld2::receive_msg! which is a member of !this! class (!HelloWorld2!).''\footnote{You can call a member function (method) of another class by passing the pointer to the desired class instantiation instead of \texttt{this}. Alternatively, you can call a non-class function by just giving its pointer, e.g. \texttt{subscribe(\&receive\_msg)}.}. The method provided as a callback (here !receive_msg()!) must have the signature
\begin{boxedverbatim}
void func(const ProtoBufMessage&); 
\end{boxedverbatim}
\resetbvlinenumber
where !ProtoBufMessage! is the type subscribed for (here, !HelloWorldMsg!). !receive_msg()! has that signature
\begin{boxedverbatim}
void HelloWorld2::receive_msg(const HelloWorldMsg& msg);
\end{boxedverbatim}
\resetbvlinenumber
and thus is a valid callback for this subscription. After subscribing, !receive_msg()! will be called immediately (an \gls{asynchronous} event) upon receipt of a message of type !HelloWorldMsg! unless
\begin{itemize}
\item !loop()! is in the process of being called or
\item another message callback is in the process of being called.
\end{itemize}
In these cases, !receive_msg()! is called as soon as the blocking method returns. For this example, inside of !receive_msg()! we simply post the message to the debug log:

\begin{boxedverbatim}
void receive_msg(const HelloWorldMsg& msg)
{
   glogger() << "received: " << msg << std::endl;
}
\end{boxedverbatim}
\resetbvlinenumber

The full source listing for !hello_world2_g! can be found in section \ref{sec:hello_world2.cpp}.

\section{Compiling our applications using CMake}

CMake \cite{cmake}, while still lacking in documentation, is probably the easiest way to build software these days, especially for cross platform support. I will briefly walk through building a Goby application using CMake within the larger Goby project configuration. If you look at the !CMakeLists.txt! file in \ref{sec:hello_world:CMakeLists.txt}, you can see the steps needed to add our new applications to the project:

\begin{boxedverbatim}
protobuf_generate_cpp(PROTO_SRCS PROTO_HDRS hello_world.proto)
add_executable(hello_world1_g hello_world1.cpp ${PROTO_SRCS} ${PROTO_HDRS})
target_link_libraries(hello_world1_g goby_core)
\end{boxedverbatim}
\resetbvlinenumber

Line 1 tells CMake to add ``hello\_world.proto'' to the files needed to be pre-compiled by the Google Protocol Buffers compiler !protoc!. protobuf\_generate\_cpp is provided by the CMake module \href{http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~goby-dev/goby/trunk/annotate/head:/cmake_modules/FindProtobufGoby.cmake}{goby/cmake\_modules/FindProtobufGoby.cmake}. Line 2 adds our application !hello_world1_g! to the list to be compiled by the C++ compiler, using the sources !hello_world1.cpp! and the generated Protocol Buffers code. We append ``\_g'' as a convention to quickly recognize Goby applications. Line 3 links our application against the goby\_core library, which provides goby::core::ApplicationBase, our base class.

Adding !hello_world2_g! is directly analogous.

\section{Trying it all out: running from the command line}

Now, assuming you've compiled everything, we can run the example.

You'll need three terminal windows, one for !gobyd!, and one for each of our ``hello world'' applications. You need to start !gobyd! first
\begin{boxedverbatim}
> gobyd -p hello_auv
\end{boxedverbatim}
\resetbvlinenumber
I've gone ahead and named this platform ``hello\_auv''. The platform name is a unique identifier for both intra- and inter-vehicle communications in Goby. Now we can launch our two applications (order doesn't matter), with the added ``-v'' flag to indicate we want verbose terminal output:

\begin{boxedverbatim}
> hello_world1_g -p hello_auv -v
> hello_world2_g -p hello_auv -v
\end{boxedverbatim}
\resetbvlinenumber

You should see !hello_world1_g! passing messages to !hello_world2_g! every 1/10th second.
