This example includes simple.alog which has NAV_X, NAV_Y, NAV_DEPTH from a real vehicle doing YOYO manuevers.

To convert to an SQLite3 database, do:

***
alog_to_goby_db alog_to_goby_db_simple.pb.cfg
***

which writes "simple.db" (see alog_to_goby_db_simple.pb.cfg). I find it helpful to use `sqliteman` (in Ubuntu: 'sudo apt-get install sqliteman') to view the database. You can also use the `sqlite3` command line tool ('sudo apt-get install sqlite3').

*** 
sqliteman simple.db
***

You will see two tables "_raw" and "cmoosmsg". Ignore "_raw" and expand "cmoosmsg" (double click on it). You will see a full listing of this table which is similar to the alog file contents (but in queryable database). Try typing 

***
select * from cmoosmsg where key = "NAV_DEPTH"
***
in the query box (upper right) and click run (F9). You will see only NAV_DEPTH variables.

To run queries in MATLAB (instead of in `sqliteman` or `sqlite3`), use the third-party "mksqlite" package.

You can download mksqlite from http://mksqlite.berlios.de/mksqlite_eng.html. Unzip the package, and run the "builtit.m" script located within to create a MEX file (mksqlite.mex*). Put that mex file in your MATLAB path. Also put the helper script sqlite_reader.m located in goby-2.0/src/moos/tools/alog_to_goby_db in your MATLAB path.

An example "simple.m" that uses sqlite_reader.m is located in goby-2.0/share/examples/moos/alog_to_goby_db_simple. Run this script and it query the database will plot depth versus time. In general you will want to run `sqlite_reader` once for each query and then store the returned MATLAB struct to do your analysis, since running complicated queries can take some time.

Clearly you will need to know SQL Select queries to use these tools. A quick Google search on "SQL select" should turn up some references or you can refer to one of many books on SQL.

Very roughly, a typical query looks like this:

SELECT [database.][tablename.]col1, [database].[tablename].col2 FROM [database].tablename WHERE col1 = "something" ORDER BY col2 ASC

Items in [] can be omitted if unambiguous.

e.g.

SELECT key, double_value FROM cmoosmsg WHERE key LIKE 'NAV%'

selects all NAV* entries
