the examples are intended to be examined in this order:

'simple'
'two_message'
'plusnet'
'test'

if the user has no interest in MOOS or the related string parsing / formatting capabilities of libdccl, he can skip 'plusnet'.

'test' is included in here for the interested user as it includes how to use algorithms. i use this process to ensure correct operation of the DCCL decode / encode but it may be a bit dense to follow.
