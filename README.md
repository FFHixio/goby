## goby project


The Goby Underwater Autonomy Project aims to create a unified framework for multiple scientific autonomous marine vehicle collaboration, seamlessly incorporating acoustic, ethernet, wifi, and serial communications. Presently the main thrust of the project is developing a set of robust acoustic networking libraries.

As of release 2.1.1, Goby uses the standalone DCCL project: https://github.com/GobySoft/dccl
