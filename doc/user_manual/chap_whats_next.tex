\chapter{What's next}

That's all for \verb|goby-core| in Release 1.0. There's still a lot to do so keep tuned. If you want the bleeding edge, you can check out the Goby trunk branch with 
\verb|bzr checkout lp:goby|.

Here's what's on the horizon:
\begin{itemize}
\item support for seamless inter-platform communications via acoustics (acomms), serial, wifi, and ethernet. Maybe even two cans and a string.
\item a \verb|Wt| \cite{wt} based configuration, launch, and runtime manager.
\end{itemize}

Stay tuned at \url{https://launchpad.net/goby}. Thanks.
